  abstract = {Modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a promising topology for medium- and high-power conversion systems. In recent years, it has been prominent over other power converters because of its exceptional features, including modularity and flexibility to adapt any voltage level, remarkable harmonic performance, no dc-link capacitors, transformerless operation, absence of ac-side filters, and capacitive nature of phase legs. However, there are some challenges, for instance, submodule (SM) capacitor voltage balancing, output current control, circulating current control, minimization of SM capacitor voltage ripple, dc-side faults, and efficient SM topologies that have been addressed by the research studies over time. In this article, we focus on the recent advancements in SM structures and their capability to overcome the faults, reduction in switching losses, decrease in voltage sensor count, and minimization of SM capacitor voltage ripple and provide the quick restoration of SM capacitor voltages after the removal of faults. Finally, the applications and development prospects of MMC are discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {It is expected that in the near future the use of highvoltage dc (HVDC) transmission and medium-voltage dc (MVDC) distribution technology will expand. This development is driven by the growing share of electrical power generation by renewable energy sources that are located far from load centers and the increased use of distributed power generators in the distribution grid. Power converters that transfer the electric energy between voltage levels and control the power flow in dc grids will be key components in these systems. The recently presented modular multilevel dc converter (M2DC) and the three-phase dual-active bridge converter (DAB) are benchmarked for this task. Three scenarios are examined: a 15 MW converter for power conversion from an HVDC grid to an MVDC grid of a university campus, a gigawatt converter for feeding the energy from an MVDC collector grid of a wind farm into the HVDC grid, and a converter that acts as a power controller between two HVDC grids with the same nominal voltage level. The operation and degrees of freedom of the M2DC are investigated in detail aiming for an optimal design of this converter. The M2DC and the DAB converter are thoroughly compared for the given scenarios in terms of efficiency, amount of semiconductor devices, and expense on capacitive storage and magnetic components.},

  abstract = {The recent advances in power plants and energy resources have extended the applications of buck-boost converters in the context of dc microgrids (MGs). However, the implementation of such interface systems in the MG applications is seriously threatened with instability issues imposed by the constant power loads (CPLs). The objective is that without the accurate modeling information of a dc MG system, to develop a new adaptive control methodology for voltage stabilization of the dc–dc converters feeding CPLs with low ripples. To achieve this goal, in this letter, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique with the Actor–Critic architecture is incorporated into an ultralocal model (ULM) control scheme to address the destabilization effect of the CPLs under the reference voltage variations. In the suggested control approach, the feedback controller gains of the ULM controller are considered as the adjustable controller coefficients, which will be adaptively designed by the DRL technique through online learning of its neural networks (NNs). It is proved that the suggested scheme will ensure the rigorous stability of the power electronic system, for simultaneous effects of CPL and reference voltage changes, by adaptively adjusting the ULM controller gains. To appraise the merits and usefulness of the suggested adaptive methodology, some dSPACE MicroLabBox outcomes on a real-time testbed of the dc–dc converter feeding a CPL are presented.},

They have their own issues which need to be improved or optimized in order to run neck by neck for being compatible for the efficient designs.

Two, essentially different, analysis methods were presented. It was demonstrated that very precise sizing of the converter parts can be performed in case branch currents, during the leg voltage transition process, are known.},

Specifically, a proportional-resonant type minor loop is incorporated to regulate the most AC components of the circulating current to zero in addition to the DC regulation loop. The proposed minor loop can also be applied to single phase MMC, which is not available in previous methods.

Not only is this modulation applicable to MMCs constructed with classic two level (2L) submodules, but it is also effective for arrangements with different submodule concepts, for instance, topologies like neutral point clamped (NPC), flying capacitors (FCs), neutral point piloted (NPP), etc. Therefore, firstly, the general modulation philosophy is explained applied to the two level (2L) submodule concept, and secondly, the extension to 3L-NPC and 3L-FC submodule topologies is analyzed. After that, the validation of the studied modulation strategy is carried out by means of successful simulation results, at different switching frequencies and number of submodules. The corresponding experimental results are shown in Part II of this paper after having implemented the aforementioned modulation strategy in a real test bench. In addition to this, a comparison based on thermal analysis and sizing of elements among the four studied submodule topologies is also included.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of an advanced digital controller for a 1-kW H-bridge dc–dc power converter. A new control algorithm based on the active disturbance rejection concept is developed to cope with the highly nonlinear dynamics of the converter and the disturbances. An experimental digital control system is used to implement the new control strategy. It consists of a digital control board based on the TMS320C6711 digital signal processor chip, an analogy I/O board, and a complex programmable logic device pulsewidth-modulation generation board. Using a newly developed bandwidth-paramerization technique, an autotuning method based on noise quantification is also developed and tested. Experimental results show the advantages and flexibilities of the new control method for the H-bridge dc–dc power converter.},

The model is intended for time domain simulations in an electromechanical simulation program with a balanced positive sequence network representation. Typical applications are transient stability studies and performance analysis of the HVDC link within a large scale AC network. The new developed model is validated against a much more accurate electro-magnetic model comprising all parts of the complex converter control and the protection circuits.},

Digital low-pass filters are essential to the functionality of a delta-sigma ADC, which relies on oversampling and noise shaping to push quantization noise out of band. There are variations between the types of digital filters used in delta-sigma ADCs that provide various benefits and drawbacks that orient them to different applications. The types of filters and the tradeoffs between them are discussed in this report.},

The proposed system is especially useful for computationally intensive algorithms and applications with high demands on the number of required measurements and gate signals. The focus is on a heterogeneous system architecture with minimized latency and jitter as well as a high signal integrity. The software architecture enables a simple, fast and performance driven implementation. A combination of carrier board and exchangeable interfacing adapter boards allows to control a wide range of power electronics applications and converters, i.e., starting with a single switching device, converters with one or several voltage levels and one or several phase legs, up to large modular multilevel converters for grid-tied connection or variable speed drives.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the design and implementation in real time of a nonlinear control for a wind energy conversion system (WECS). The Backstepping control has been implemented to improve the performance of the conversion system based on a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) connected to the grid. Two static back-to-back converters ensure grid connection and are controlled by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The proposed control algorithm ensures proper speed control to extract maximum power. First of all, a WECS full review has been discussed. Thereafter, a Backstepping control laws detailed description based on the Lyapunov stability technique has been reported. Consequently, these control thus helping it possible to operate the complete system in the best performances in the static and dynamic regimes. The second part of this article has been devoted to the Backstepping control experimental validation using the dSPACE DS1104 control board and the Matlab–Simulink environment in order to check and validate the system efficiency. The results achieved have been clearly responded to the requirements of robustness and follow-up of references even under fluctuating wind conditions, and confirmed the control effectiveness in both static and dynamic operating modes.},
