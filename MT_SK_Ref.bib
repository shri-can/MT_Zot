  abstract = {This paper introduces a model developed for modeling the steady-state and the dynamic behavior of the Trans Bay Cable Project as Voltage-Sourced Converter based on the Modular Multilevel Converter design. The model is intended for time domain simulations in an electromechanical simulation program with a balanced positive sequence network representation. Typical applications are transient stability studies and performance analysis of the HVDC link within a large scale AC network. The new developed model is validated against a much more accurate electro-magnetic model comprising all parts of the complex converter control and the protection circuits.},
