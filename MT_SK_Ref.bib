  abstract = {Modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a promising topology for medium- and high-power conversion systems. In recent years, it has been prominent over other power converters because of its exceptional features, including modularity and flexibility to adapt any voltage level, remarkable harmonic performance, no dc-link capacitors, transformerless operation, absence of ac-side filters, and capacitive nature of phase legs. However, there are some challenges, for instance, submodule (SM) capacitor voltage balancing, output current control, circulating current control, minimization of SM capacitor voltage ripple, dc-side faults, and efficient SM topologies that have been addressed by the research studies over time. In this article, we focus on the recent advancements in SM structures and their capability to overcome the faults, reduction in switching losses, decrease in voltage sensor count, and minimization of SM capacitor voltage ripple and provide the quick restoration of SM capacitor voltages after the removal of faults. Finally, the applications and development prospects of MMC are discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {The application and research interest over modular multilevel converters (MMCs) has grown significantly over the last couple of years. The term MMC has been expanded to include all converters built on the series connection of sub-modules (SMs) as a basic building block forming converter arms and phaselegs. A review of the current literature reveals an abundance of SM configurations ranging from SMs derived from the wellknown multilevel converter topologies to novel configurations targeted to niche MMC applications. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current SM configuration state and a comparative evaluation based on complexity of configuration, voltage balancing and component count. It also provides an evaluation of switching and conduction losses for the devices within each SM, identifying those SMs that are more suitable to general MMC applications.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive analysis of the so-called quasi two-level converter leg was provided in the last part of this thesis. Quasi two-level operating principles imply the sequential and smooth transition of the converter leg AC voltage from one polarity to another. However, the transition occurs in the discrete time steps, being referred to as the dwell time, which makes the analysis of the converter branch currents rather non-trivial. Two, essentially different, analysis methods were presented. It was demonstrated that very precise sizing of the converter parts can be performed in case branch currents, during the leg voltage transition process, are known.},

  abstract = {Modular multilevel converter is a next generation multilevel converters for medium to high voltage conversion applications, such as medium voltage motor drive and high voltage direct current transmission. One potential issue of this type of converter is the AC circulating current, which increases the current stress and brings additional conduction loss to the system. This paper proposes modified control architecture for modular multilevel converters, aiming at suppressing the AC components in the circulating current. Specifically, a proportional-resonant type minor loop is incorporated to regulate the most AC components of the circulating current to zero in addition to the DC regulation loop. The proposed minor loop can also be applied to single phase MMC, which is not available in previous methods. Simulation results for a three\- phase MMC operating as an inverter are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.},

An experimental digital control system is used to implement the new control strategy. It consists of a digital control board based on the TMS320C6711 digital signal processor chip, an analogy I/O board, and a complex programmable logic device pulsewidth-modulation generation board. Using a newly developed bandwidth-paramerization technique, an autotuning method based on noise quantification is also developed and tested.

  abstract = {This paper describes the design and implementation in real time of a nonlinear control for a wind energy conversion system (WECS). The Backstepping control has been implemented to improve the performance of the conversion system based on a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) connected to the grid. Two static back-to-back converters ensure grid connection and are controlled by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The proposed control algorithm ensures proper speed control to extract maximum power. First of all, a WECS full review has been discussed. Thereafter, a Backstepping control laws detailed description based on the Lyapunov stability technique has been reported. Consequently, these control thus helping it possible to operate the complete system in the best performances in the static and dynamic regimes. The second part of this article has been devoted to the Backstepping control experimental validation using the dSPACE DS1104 control board and the Matlab\textendash Simulink environment in order to check and validate the system efficiency. The results achieved have been clearly responded to the requirements of robustness and follow-up of references even under fluctuating wind conditions, and confirmed the control effectiveness in both static and dynamic operating modes.},
