  abstract = {Modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a promising topology for medium- and high-power conversion systems. In recent years, it has been prominent over other power converters because of its exceptional features, including modularity and flexibility to adapt any voltage level, remarkable harmonic performance, no dc-link capacitors, transformerless operation, absence of ac-side filters, and capacitive nature of phase legs. However, there are some challenges, for instance, submodule (SM) capacitor voltage balancing, output current control, circulating current control, minimization of SM capacitor voltage ripple, dc-side faults, and efficient SM topologies that have been addressed by the research studies over time. In this article, we focus on the recent advancements in SM structures and their capability to overcome the faults, reduction in switching losses, decrease in voltage sensor count, and minimization of SM capacitor voltage ripple and provide the quick restoration of SM capacitor voltages after the removal of faults. Finally, the applications and development prospects of MMC are discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {The recent advances in power plants and energy resources have extended the applications of buck-boost converters in the context of dc microgrids (MGs). However, the implementation of such interface systems in the MG applications is seriously threatened with instability issues imposed by the constant power loads (CPLs). The objective is that without the accurate modeling information of a dc MG system, to develop a new adaptive control methodology for voltage stabilization of the dc\textendash dc converters feeding CPLs with low ripples. To achieve this goal, in this letter, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique with the Actor\textendash Critic architecture is incorporated into an ultralocal model (ULM) control scheme to address the destabilization effect of the CPLs under the reference voltage variations. In the suggested control approach, the feedback controller gains of the ULM controller are considered as the adjustable controller coefficients, which will be adaptively designed by the DRL technique through online learning of its neural networks (NNs). It is proved that the suggested scheme will ensure the rigorous stability of the power electronic system, for simultaneous effects of CPL and reference voltage changes, by adaptively adjusting the ULM controller gains. To appraise the merits and usefulness of the suggested adaptive methodology, some dSPACE MicroLabBox outcomes on a real-time testbed of the dc\textendash dc converter feeding a CPL are presented.},

The term MMC has been expanded to include all converters built on the series connection of sub-modules (SMs) as a basic building block forming converter arms and phaselegs. A review of the current literature reveals an abundance of SM configurations ranging from SMs derived from the wellknown multilevel converter topologies to novel configurations targeted to niche MMC applications. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current SM configuration state and a comparative evaluation based on complexity of configuration, voltage balancing and component count. It also provides an evaluation of switching and conduction losses for the devices within each SM, identifying those SMs that are more suitable to general MMC applications.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive analysis of the so-called quasi two-level converter leg was provided in the last part of this thesis. Quasi two-level operating principles imply the sequential and smooth transition of the converter leg AC voltage from one polarity to another. However, the transition occurs in the discrete time steps, being referred to as the dwell time, which makes the analysis of the converter branch currents rather non-trivial. Two, essentially different, analysis methods were presented. It was demonstrated that very precise sizing of the converter parts can be performed in case branch currents, during the leg voltage transition process, are known.},

The proposed controller concurrently with field-programmable gate array implementation permits to achieve a constant switching frequency and an optimal current ripple along with a high currentloop bandwidth and robust behavior to parameter variation. A disturbance observer has been added to the proposed controller in order to compensate for the converter voltage distortions. The proposed control strategy is tested through both simulations and experiments.},

This allows to put the focus on the research topics themselves rather than spending a high effort on the pure implementation of the theoretical research results. The system described in this paper consists of a software environment/toolchain and a hardware platform. The hardware platform can be subdivided into a power electronics platform and a System on Chip based signal processing system. Besides the hardware platform also a user-friendly software environment/toolchain for modelbased research is developed and illustrated in this paper.

One potential issue of this type of converter is the AC circulating current, which increases the current stress and brings additional conduction loss to the system. This paper proposes modified control architecture for modular multilevel converters, aiming at suppressing the AC components in the circulating current. Specifically, a proportional-resonant type minor loop is incorporated to regulate the most AC components of the circulating current to zero in addition to the DC regulation loop. The proposed minor loop can also be applied to single phase MMC, which is not available in previous methods. Simulation results for a three\- phase MMC operating as an inverter are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.},

Two static back-to-back converters ensure grid connection and are controlled by Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The proposed control algorithm ensures proper speed control to extract maximum power. First of all, a WECS full review has been discussed. Thereafter, a Backstepping control laws detailed description based on the Lyapunov stability technique has been reported. Consequently, these control thus helping it possible to operate the complete system in the best performances in the static and dynamic regimes. The second part of this article has been devoted to the Backstepping control experimental validation using the dSPACE DS1104 control board and the Matlab\textendash Simulink environment in order to check and validate the system efficiency.
